# Persistent Memory Development Kit

## Anchor note
In the ported versions, the ones with the `_opt` suffix are the secured ones.
The other versions perform data management in place sometimes which renders them insecure (no freshness guarantees).

## This is examples/libpmemobj/README.

This directory contains examples for libpmemobj, the library providing
a transactional object store for pmem.  Some of these examples are explained
in more detail here: https://pmem.io/pmdk/libpmemobj

manpage.c and setjmp.c are the examples used in the libpmemobj man page.

To build these examples:
	make

These examples can be built against an installed system using:
	make LIBDIR=/usr/lib INCDIR=/usr/include

If you're looking for documentation to get you started using PMDK,

man pages.
