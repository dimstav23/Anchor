you take a timestamp by calling
get_tsc()
and you can convert it into "real time" with
get_time_in_ms or get_time_in_s
take_time and take_time_diff are wrapper functions, which give you the time of one method call, so you can give it a method and the arguments it should be called with and it returns the time it took to execute the methods and the return value of the method

if you need other units for time you can easily add another function call by i.e.
//rdtsc.h
uint64_t get_time_in_us(size_t tsc_value);
//rdtsc.cpp
uint64_t get_time_in_us(size_t tsc_value) {
  return get_time_<uint64_t, 1'000'000, 1>(tsc_value);
}
